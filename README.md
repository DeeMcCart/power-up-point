## Intro
This wonderful project is just basically awesome.  What else can I say....?  Not to mention the project team, well, we are awesome as well.  Obviously.

<- OK I will replace this with several descriptive paragraphs of our project says Deirdre!!>

## Goal


- ‚û°Ô∏è Problem Statement
EV owners can encounter obstacles when attempting to charge their vehicle away from home, including locating an appropriate point, accessing it, bringing a connecting cable if needed, queueing, planning the charge duration, and, if at an inconvenient location, possibly needing to wait with the vehicle for the EV charge to complete.

The **GreenerToday** team started with an analysis of existing websites 
[(details here)](//assets/readme_files/ux_competitor_sites.pdf) and observed:  
* Many of the websites are proprietary, and show incomplete information (e.g. don't show competing providers chargers).
* Map-based searching often shows summary information when the user zooms out (e.g. 5 charges in Arklow), however, if the user is attempting to plan a trip, they then need to zoom in and out to get the required detail
* Only one of the websites audited shows available/in use status, and none show 'out of order' status

- ‚û°Ô∏è Objective(s)

**PowerUpPoint** site aims to make the identification of a well located, suitable charging point, easier for users.

- ‚û°Ô∏è Target Audience

EV drivers who require a re-charge at a public charging station.  Typically away from their domestic chargers, because of trip distance and/or duration.  These users may (although not always) be in a loction unfamiliar to them, and may depend on **PowerUpPoint's** data to make choices. 

- ‚û°Ô∏è Benefits

PowerUpPoint provides an agnostic (not tied to one particular supplier), map based, user-centric portal for users to conveniently establish locality and features of charging points.

## User Stories

### First-time user Goals
- FTU01 As a first-time user I want to able to understand the purpose of the website instantly, so that I can quickly gain benefit from using it
- FTU02 As a first-time user I want to easily navigate the website, in a logical and intuitive  way, so that I can quickly gain benefit from using it 
- FTU03  As a first-time user and prospective EV purchaser, I want to be able to see the location and suitability of charging stations in particular geographic locations, so that I can evaluate availability of stations near my home/work/frequently travelled routes
- FTU04 As a first time/ returning user I would like to receive mapped directions to get from my location to the charging location.


### Returning user Goals
- RU01 As a first time/returning user I want to be able to search for charging stations within a given locality
- RU02 As a returning user I would like the initial displayed map to be relevant (ie to default to my approximate location)
- RU03 As a first time/returning user I want to be able to see more information about the charging point, so that I can determine if it is appropriate for my needs
- RU04 As a returning user I want to be able to contact the website provider  (to inform them of new charging locations not shown on map, problems with existing charging locations, new ideas for the website..)
- RU05 As a returning user I want to be able to provide feedback about the charging points, so that I can report charging points out of order, or with restricted access

### Site owner Goals
- SO_01 As an administrator I want to be able to include details of privately-operated as well as publicly-offered (e.g. ESB) charging points, so the site users are offered the most complete data
- SO_02 As website administrator I would like to re-use an open-source/non proprietary EV charging dataset as the primary data source, to avoid the overhead of core data capture/maintenance
- SO_03 As website administrator I would like to show 'rich' data on each EV charging point, e.g. charging type, any restrictions on opening hours, amenities available while waiting, unit charges/price band,  ...to make the website more useful and relevant to users   

### Nice to haves/ Future Development:

 - RU_06 As a returning user I want to be able to save journeys and add charging stations to my favourites
- RU_07 As a returning user I would like to be able apply filters when searching, for example only seeing charge points suitable for my vehicle 
- RU_08 As a returning user I would LOVE to be able to combine journey planning with EV locations, rather than using 2 separate apps (google maps for journey planning,  and charge point maps for charging points) which I then need to manually combine
- RU_09 As a user I would LOVE to be able to estimate the charging time needed for my vehicle at a particular charging point
- SO_04 As website administrator I would like to share user feedback on individual charging point with other users (e.g. faulty stations)
